2. Verify that the embedding model (e.g., "text-embedding-3-large") is available and properly specified.
3. Ensure that the input text for embedding generation is properly formatted and not too long.
4. Check for any errors in the embedding generation process in the logs.

### Q: Stored memories are missing data or have incorrect information.

A: This could be due to issues in the memory processing pipeline:

1. Review the memory processing logic in `utils/memories/process_memory.py` for any bugs.
2. Check if all required fields are being properly extracted and stored.
3. Verify that the structured data extraction from OpenAI is working correctly.
4. Ensure that the Firestore write operations are successful and not being interrupted.

## Performance and Scaling Challenges

### Q: The backend is slow to respond during high traffic periods.

A: Consider the following optimizations:

1. Implement caching for frequently accessed data using Redis.
2. Optimize database queries and indexes in Firestore.
3. Use asynchronous processing for time-consuming tasks.
4. Consider scaling up your Google Cloud Run instances or implementing auto-scaling.

### Q: Memory retrieval is becoming slow as the number of memories increases.

A: Optimize your vector search process:

1. Ensure you're using efficient filtering in Pinecone queries.
2. Implement pagination for large result sets.
