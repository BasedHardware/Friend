  - A code editor (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm)

## I. Setting Up Google Cloud & Firebase ‚òÅÔ∏è

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK:**
   ```bash
   # Mac (using brew)
   brew install google-cloud-sdk
   
   # Nix Envdir users: The SDK is usually pre-installed
   
   # For other systems, follow the official Google Cloud SDK installation guide
   ```

2. **Enable Necessary APIs:**
   - Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Select your project
   - Go to APIs & Services -> Library
   - Search for and enable these APIs:
     - Cloud Resource Manager API
     - Firebase Management API
     - Cloud Storage API
     - Cloud Firestore API

3. **Authenticate with Google Cloud:**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project <project-id>
   gcloud auth application-default login --project <project-id>
   ```
   This generates `application_default_credentials.json` in `~/.config/gcloud`.

   **Note:** If you encounter any permission issues, ensure your Google account has the necessary roles (e.g., Project Owner, Firebase Admin) in the Google Cloud Console.

## II. Backend Setup üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Install Python & Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Mac (using brew)
   brew install python@3.11 git ffmpeg
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3.11 python3-pip git ffmpeg
   
   # Install pip if not present (Mac)
   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   python3 get-pip.py
   ```

2. **Clone the Backend Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BasedHardware/Omi.git
   cd Omi/backend
   ```

3. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv omi_env
   source omi_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: omi_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Set up the Environment File:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and fill in all required API keys and settings. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables-) section for detailed explanations.

5. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If you encounter any issues, try:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
   ```

## III. Running the Backend Locally üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Set up Ngrok for Tunneling:**
   - Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and install Ngrok
   - Authenticate Ngrok with your account:
     ```bash
     ngrok authtoken <your-auth-token>
     ```
   - Create a tunnel to your localhost:
     ```bash
     ngrok http --domain=example.ngrok-free.app 8000
     ```
   **Note:** Keep the Ngrok terminal window open while developing.

2. **Start the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --env-file .env --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   - `--reload`: Automatically restarts the server when code changes are detected
   - `--env-file .env`: Loads environment variables from the .env file
   - `--host 0.0.0.0`: Allows external access to the server
   - `--port 8000`: Specifies the port to run the server on

3. **Verify the Server:**
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs`. You should see the Swagger UI documentation for the API.

4. **Connect the App to the Backend:**
   - In your Omi app's environment, set `API_BASE_URL` to the Ngrok URL (e.g., `https://example.ngrok-free.app`)

## Environment Variables üîê

Detailed explanation of each variable in your `.env` file:

- `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`: Your Hugging Face API token for downloading speech processing models
- `BUCKET_SPEECH_PROFILES`: Name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket for storing user speech profiles
- `BUCKET_BACKUPS`: Name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket for backups (if applicable)
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Full path to your Google Cloud credentials JSON file
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key for vector database operations
- `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`: Name of your Pinecone index (create this in the Pinecone console)
- `REDIS_DB_HOST`: Hostname of your Redis instance (e.g., `redis-12345.c56.us-east-1-3.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com`)
- `REDIS_DB_PORT`: Port number for your Redis instance (usually 6379)
- `REDIS_DB_PASSWORD`: Password for your Redis instance
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`: Your Deepgram API key for real-time and pre-recorded audio transcription
- `ADMIN_KEY`: A secure key for admin-level API access (generate a strong, random string)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing language models and embeddings
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token (if using GitHub for firmware updates)
- `WORKFLOW_API_KEY`: Custom API key for securing communication with external workflows
- `HUME_API_KEY`: Your Hume AI API key for emotional analysis features (if enabled)

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's added to `.gitignore` by default.

## Modal Serverless Deployment üöÄ

For deploying the backend using Modal:

1. **Install Modal:**
   ```bash
   pip install modal
   ```

2. **Set up Modal secrets:**
   ```bash
   modal secret create gcp-credentials
   modal secret create envs
   ```
   Follow the prompts to input your Google Cloud credentials and environment variables.

3. **Prepare for Deployment:**
   Ensure your `main.py` file is configured for Modal deployment. It should include:
   ```python
   from modal import Image, Stub, asgi_app
   
   stub = Stub("omi-backend")
   
   image = Image.debian_slim().pip_install_from_requirements("requirements.txt")
   
   @stub.function(image=image)
   @asgi_app()
   def fastapi_app():
       from main import app
       return app
   ```

4. **Deploy to Modal:**
   ```bash
   modal deploy main.py
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment:**
   Modal will provide a URL for your deployed app. Visit `<modal-url>/docs` to ensure the API is accessible.

## Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide üîß

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **SSL Certificate Errors:**
   If you encounter SSL certificate errors when downloading models, add this to `utils/stt/vad.py`:
   ```python
   import ssl
   ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
   ```
   **Note:** This is a temporary workaround and should not be used in production.

2. **API Key Issues:**
   - Double-check all API keys in `.env` for accuracy
   - Ensure there are no trailing spaces or quotes around the keys
   - Verify that your API keys have the necessary permissions and are active

3. **Ngrok Connection Problems:**
   - Ensure Ngrok is running and the tunnel is active
   - Verify the Ngrok URL is correctly set in the Omi app's `API_BASE_URL`
   - Check Ngrok's console for any error messages or warnings

4. **Dependency Installation Failures:**
   If you encounter issues installing dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade --force-reinstall
   ```
   If problems persist, try installing dependencies one by one to identify the problematic package.

5. **Database Connection Errors:**
   - Verify your Firestore and Redis connection settings
   - Ensure your Google Cloud project has Firestore enabled
   - Check if your IP is whitelisted in Redis (if using Upstash)

6. **"Module Not Found" Errors:**
   - Ensure you're in the correct virtual environment
   - Try reinstalling the specific module:
     ```bash
     pip install <module-name>
     ```
