Thin-Film Batteries
   ◦ These are ideal for wearables due to their slim profile and flexibility, allowing them to be integrated into designs that require the                     battery to conform to curved surfaces or compact spaces.

Considerations

When selecting an alternative battery, several factors need to be considered:
    • Voltage and Capacity: Ensure the battery's voltage matches what the XIAO nRF52840 Sense can handle and that it provides enough capacity to        run the wearable for the desired period.
    • Physical Size and Shape: The battery should fit within the physical constraints of the wearable's design.
    • Connector Type: The battery should have a compatible connector for the XIAO board or an adapter should be available.
    • Rechargeability: For user convenience and sustainability, a rechargeable battery is preferable.
